# VRCDN

### Who are we?
VRCDN is a media platform designed specifically for VR to help create a much better streaming experience instead of having to ask "is it working for you? I just get a white screen"
    

### Our aims and goals
- A mesh of servers in key regions 
- Achieve livestreams with latencies as low as 200 miliseconds within VR platforms 
- Be fully funded by the community to help keep costs to you as low as possible
- Research and develop further tools to help create manage streams and events within VR platforms.
- Relaying streams to external platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, etc.
- Allow one account to be used by multiple people (a group throwing a party and using one account to host all of their DJs for example)

    
### Commercial Events
 For events that have over 1000 concurrent viewers we ask that you let us know in advance so that I can provide a custom quote and ensure there is enough capacity for the event to run smoothly. To further expand on this, commercial events can be requested by anyone regardless of size and can include these extra benefits: 
- Meetings with VRCDN staff to help build stream workflows
- An OBS instance hosted by VRCDN
- Extra keys
- Other features on request
